// ghwor - NativeXRenderer for Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock: the game's D3D entry points and its D3D device and
// object layouts.
//
// The XDK Direct3D library is linked into default.xex (XDK 2.0.11164) at 0x822D02A0-0x822EFCD0, the draws included
// (0x822D18A0-0x822D2170), with XGraphics-style helpers inside it (0x822D63D0-0x822D7EF0). It is GH5's (XDK 2.0.8276)
// library recompiled: each of the hooked functions found by a function matcher over both executables' instruction
// indexes has GH5's instruction count (Resolve and Present a few more), and only device offsets differ. The device
// layout is GH5's up to the vertex declaration (the dirty masks, the constants, the register shadow, the fence and the
// flags at the same offsets, each used as often in both libraries); from it on every field is 168 bytes later, the
// draw state at the end 176 to 212. The resource objects are GH5's. Every address and offset here, with its evidence,
// is in docs/native-x-renderer-ghwor.md. The hooks only run the original function unless a NativeXRenderer feature
// is on (--native_x_renderer_trace, --native_x_renderer_verify, --native_x_renderer).

// Draws. DrawVerticesUP (sub_822D1D38) commits its packets with an inlined EndVertices ([dev+48] = [dev+13652]); the

// (sub_822D1890), which is that same store. EndVertices is not hooked: inline_draw_end commits all of them. GH5's
