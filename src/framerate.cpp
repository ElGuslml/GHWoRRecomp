// ghwor - frame rates above 60: the emulated vertical blank at the chosen rate.
//
// No patch for a higher frame rate exists for any Guitar Hero (Xenia Canary's game patches, RPCS3's patches,
// 2026-10-25): they run at 60 on the consoles. The game's own pacing (sub_825840F0, the render thread presenting a
// frame) is all vertical blanks:
// - one frame in flight: it waits until the swap counter 0x8298C1F0 (sub_8239FDC0; the swap callback sub_8239FB98
//   adds one when a frame is shown) passes the previous frame's;
// - then the present interval, from the global 0x828590A0 (1: each frame sub_823DC808, through sub_823DD7B0 from the
//   main thread's frame, stores in it the script global 0x7C22B645, an integer 1 in the scripts): 1 = every vertical
//   blank (the vblank callback sub_8239FB20 counts them at 0x8298C1E0), 2 = every second one, 0 = immediate.
// The engine's clock is real time: the main thread measures each frame with the time base (sub_8242C450) and the
// game scales by the frame's duration in seconds. So with the SDK's emulated vblank at a higher rate
// (video_mode_refresh_rate, which src/options.cpp sets from ghwor_frame_rate) the game presents at that rate
// and keeps its speed (GH Metallica, the same engine: at 120 Hz it ran at 120 FPS, 8.33 ms per frame in a song, and the
// career's first song took as long from its start to the bot's failure as at 60, 74.5 s and 75.8 s; with vsync off,
// the vblank every millisecond, about 660 FPS in the menus: the game has no cap of its own).
//
// The waits of src/thread_waits.cpp follow the vblank's rate (VblankPeriod).
