// ghwor - the game's clock at the rate of the timebase it reads.
//
// The engine's timer (sub_823A0238 sets it up, sub_823A0198 and the vertical blank callback read it) measures time
// with mftb, divided by the frequency KeQueryPerformanceFrequency reports (stored at 0x8298BFC8). The original
// Xbox 360's kernel reports 50,000,000 while its timebase runs at 49,875,000 Hz, and the game corrects it: "if the
// frequency is 50,000,000, use 49,875,000". The SDK's timebase runs at 50,000,000 Hz, as it reports, so with the
// correction the game's clock ran 0.25 % fast: the notes went ahead of the song's audio, which plays at the sound
// device's 48 kHz, by about 150 ms a minute, until a pause put them back together (the game seeks the audio to its
// clock when a song resumes; measured in GH Metallica, the same code in GH Van Halen, GH5 and here). The later consoles
// (the Corona and Waitsburg boards) have the same problem with Guitar Hero.
//
// The hook keeps the frequency the SDK reports.
